# Installation

If you have a working C compiler on your system, installing this programm
should be as easy as running the compiling script provided with this
distribution in the shell:

?> ./compile_script.bash


# Run

The previous step will create an executable, 'fractalClouds', which may
be run simply by invoking in the shell:

?> ./fractalClouds


# Input

The values of the input parameters are changed by editing the file:

./src/fractalClouds.h

accordingly.

DO NOT FORGET TO RE-COMPILE AFTER EDITING FOR THE CHANGES TO HAVE AN EFFECT!


# Output

For more information about this program, the input parameters, output, 
etc., please consult the documentation; e.g. open in a broswer the file doc/html/index.html.
